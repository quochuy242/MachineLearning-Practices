# MachineLearning-Practices
This is a set of practice exercises in Fundamentals of Machine Learning, a subject at HCMUS.

## Homework 1: Linear Regression

Dataset relate to how much money a person can get from a mortgage on their home. 

In HW1 notebook, I do:

1. Preprocessing data: Replace null values, remove outliers and normalize data
2. Splitting train-test dataset and implement Linear Regression model which consists of basis Linear Reg, Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet.
3. Polynomial Transform

## Homework 2: Logistic Regression 

[link](/Week 02/TruongQuocHuy_21110308_HW2.ipynb)

Objective's homework is classifying a person having heart disease or not. 

Tasks in HW2 is quitely like HW1. I do:

1. Preprocessing data: remove outliers by quantile and normalize data based on feature's distribution
2. Reduction data by dropping feature based on small feature's correlation value
3. Implement Logistic Regression models with different solver and different penalty and compare them by using F1-Score

## Homework 3:
